She admired her elder brother Claudius, and used to play with her twin by solving his mazes. Nero cared for his only daughter and used to go horseback riding on the Augustus estate with her and make angels in the flower fields.\n\nAfter Nero's second wife and mother of all of his children died, her father couldn't look her in the eyes for 3 years. After Claudius au Augustus was killed by Karnus au Bellona, Nero separated the twins and Virginia was raised by Kavax and Niobe au Telemanus. She became good friends with their children, especially Pax, who eventually became her housemate at the Institute.",

She has keen social instincts and is able to befriend, charm, and work with others well, winning friends and allies easily. She is also highly empathetic and compassionate, though she is talented at hiding these traits so as not to show weakness.\n\nVirginia is very loyal to her family, even when they don't demonstrate the same in return. Despite her father and her brother's occasional scorn for her, Virginia does her best to ensure the strength and safety of her family, and works with them as far as her morals allow her.\n\nPolitically, Virginia has always been a Reformer by Gold standards. During her tenure under Octavia au Lune, she wrote about fairer treatment of lowColors, though she still demonstrated a degree of prejudice against them. Virginia initially doubted whether The Rising could be effective. However, her time with Darrow, his family, and other members of The Rising helped her to understand their grievances and purpose, and she eventually chose to fight with them to overthrow the Society.\n\nAfter the Society is overthrown, Virginia forms the Senate and becomes the new Sovereign. She forms The Solar Republic, bringing back democracy for the first time in almost 800 years.",

Virginia becomes Primus of her house, House Minerva, and battles against Darrow and House Mars. Though she initially seems to hold the upper-hand over him, Darrow's clever strategies and out of the box thinking take Virginia off guard, and Darrow is able to utterly destroy her house. However, he allows her to escape after fearing what some members of his house might do to her.\n\nVirginia pays Darrow back for this, rescuing him after he is betrayed by Cassius au Bellona and badly wounded. She nurses him back to health and their time together causes Darrow to be reminded of Eo when he's with her. Virginia and Darrow form an alliance and work together to defeat the other houses and even attack Olympus, where the Proctors reside. Virginia encourages Darrow to change the system and change what it means to succeed in the Institute.\n\nVirginia does not reveal to Darrow that she is the sister of the Jackal, Adrius au Augustus, one of Darrow's chief rivals. She offers to hunt her brother down for him, and much to Darrow's surprise, she comes through for him and successfully captures her brother. Darrow and House Mars thus win at the Institute.",

During her two years as a lancer of House Lune, Virginia starts a relationship with Cassius, not out of love, but instead as a further step to ensure the safety of her family.

Darrow defeats her in battle, but allows her to escape when he fears what some of his side might do to her. Virginia repays him by nursing him back to health when he is wounded. Together, they succeed in the Institute and defeat the other houses. Between the Institute and Darrow's departure for the Academy, they were in a relationship. However, Darrow's decision at the end to join her father and study at the Academy forces them apart.\n\nThey later meet when Virginia is now with Cassius, though she is mostly with him for political means and to ensure the safety of her family as opposed to genuine romantic affection. She and Darrow later reconcile and work together, rekindling their relationship. However, her discovery of his true heritage as a Red, and learning of her brother's betrayal of Darrow forces them apart yet again.\n\nIn Morning Star, Darrow discovers that she saved Orion and her fleet in time, but couldn't save Darrow at the Triumph. She later allied herself with the Moon Lords and managed to save their heirs from Luna, where Octavia had been holding them as hostages. She lost at Deimos to Roque au Fabii and Sevro au Barca refused to answer her.\n\nThey reunite once again, and this time work together to bring down the Sovereign. Despite their differences, Virginia comes to accept Darrow's agenda as leader of The Rising and advises him loyally. At the end of the novel, they are fully reconciled and Virginia reveals to Darrow that they have a son together whom she named Pax.\n\n* Cassius au Bellona\nVirginia meets Cassius at the Institute, where he is unaware of her identity as the daughter of his family's arch-rival. Virginia does not seem to think Cassius very bright, but does find him to be handsome.\n\nIn Golden Son, it is revealed that after Darrow left for the Academy, Virginia began a relationship with Cassius and was even engaged to be married to him. However, Virginia later reveals to Darrow that her relationship with Cassius was primarily to ensure the safety of her family, and not one of love. She asks Darrow to spare his life when he humiliates and defeats Cassius in a duel. Shortly after this however, Virginia ends her relationship with Cassius and begins one with Darrow.\n\nIn Morning Star, Virginia has little to do with Cassius, and makes it clear that their relationship is well behind them, to his disappointment. She does however, ask Cassius to stay and help with the new government she and Darrow intend to set up. Cassius declines and instead leaves in a self-imposed exile.",

    "text": "* Nero au Augustus\nVirginia's father Nero is a cold man who often seems dismissive of his daughter and disregards her will and beliefs. Virginia for her part disagrees with many of her father's views and the two do not get along very well. However, Nero does respect Virginia's intelligence, and sees her as being exactly like her mother, understanding her better than he lets on. Virginia in return does what she can to protect and ensure the safety of her father and their family, regardless of their tumultuous relationship. During her childhood, he was somewhat supportive and gave her more attention than he gave Adrius. After her mother died, he couldn't look at her in the eyes for 3 years.\n\n* Adrius au Augustus\nAdrius is Virginia's twin brother, he was deemed to be weaker than Virginia and their older brother Claudius from birth. However, after the death of Claudius (which he had a hand in), he was considered the heir of the family ahead of Virginia despite her being the better sibling.\n\nHer relationship with her brother is complex, as outlined by their youth where Adrius would attempt to outwit and prove himself smarter than his sister. He would have her complete mazes that were devised as a means of testing his superiority. Adrius would feign affection when Virginia solved them, and would then lash out in violence towards himself later and in private, something his sister witnessed. Thereafter, Virginia attempted to protect his feelings by pretending to not be able to solve the mazes, but Adrius would see through her facade, an ability that he continuously shows throughout the series.\n\nTheir competitive nature and Adrius's hand in the death of Claudius drove them apart, and neither has much outward affection for the other. Virginia believes that Adrius is the only person who is smarter than she is.\n\nVirginia helps Darrow defeat Adrius in the Institute, and delivers him to Darrow naked and tied up. Thereafter he bears a fierce grudge over this and murders their father Nero and drives Virginia away after Darrow's defeat in Golden Son.\n\nTheir relationship comes to a head in Morning Star, where Adrius is finally defeated and is ordered to be executed.\n\nOn the day of his execution, Adrius is hanged on Luna with an even lower gravity than Mars so as to slow the timing of his death. He hung there for some time before Virginia, newly made Sovereign, went to hold and pull him down by his legs to give him a faster death, indicating that despite everything, she did love her brother.\n\n* Claudius au Augustus\nClaudius was Virginia's elder brother. The two were close, and she looked up to him and admired him. Virginia believes that Claudius's death changed her family for the worse, and she later bears a grudge against Adrius for his part in his death.",

    "text": "* Pax au Telemanus\n\nPax and Virginia were close friends since childhood, in part due to House Augustus and House Telemanus being close, and due to Pax acting as Virginia's protector. The two have a mutual respect for one another, with Pax heeding Virginia's command and advice, and shadowing her almost at all times. In addition, it can be noted that Pax gained an immediate respect for Darrow after Mustang informed him that he was a friend.\n\nAt the end of Morning Star, it is revealed that Virginia named her and Darrow's son Pax in honor of her fallen friend.\n\n* Daxo au Telemanus\n\nDaxo and Virginia were also close, with the former at one point saving the latter from drowning. Virginia appreciates Daxo's intellect, and notably is the first to notice his modeling of himself after Milton's depiction of Lucifer in Paradise Lost. She also guessed that the gigavok in Daxo's personal skyhook (which looks similar to an engorged pair of testicles) were a metaphor for Daxo's virility and his fear that if he had children, they would eat one another.\n\nIn Dark Age, Daxo fights a mob of Vox Populi on the Day of Red Doves in order to protect Virginia, sacrificing himself so that she would survive.\n\n* Kavax au Telemanus\n\nDue to her father being rather distant, Virginia grew to see Kavax as a father figure. Like the rest of House Telemanus, the two share a deep mutual respect, with Kavax well aware of her intellect and affinity for strategy. \n\n* Thraxa au Telemanus\nBecause of how they grew up together on the Telemanus estate, Thraxa became like a sister to Virginia.\n* Sevro au Barca\n\nVirginia sees Sevro as a close friend, and is impressed by the tightly-knit relationship he has with Darrow and the rest of the Howlers. In some ways, Virginia also fears Sevro, due to his brutality and his fierce loyalty to Darrow. \n\n* Victra au Barca\n\nAlthough originally distrustful of Victra due to her House Julii heritage, she later comes to trust Victra as much as any of Darrow's liutenants, due in part to the relationship between Sevro and Victra.",
