    "text": "Before learning the bitter truth that the Reds were suffering in the mines to maintain an already terraformed Mars, Darrow was a loving husband and Helldiver of Lykos through and through. His ambitions and cravings did not extend beyond the welfare and safety of his family. He was rash and without fear when risking his life to keep up productivity in the hopes that he will win extra food for his community.\n\nDarrow was also brave, but compromising and practical if it meant safety for the people around him. Despite being pragmatic and rigid, he cared deeply for his wife and for his family, becoming wrathful after Eo's execution.\n\nAfter being carved into a Gold, Darrow struggled with the concept of losing himself, doing his best to keep in touch with his roots as a Red. He was conscious to a degree of his heritage and felt deep pride for his origins and his people. While he initially hated Golds, he came to respect some members of their caste, befriending several Golds and falling in love with another.\n\nOne of the trademarks of Darrow's personality is his anger. While still a Helldiver, he disregarded Narol's warnings of dangerous gas pockets, enraged by his uncle's hindering of his efforts to win the Laurel for their clan. During the Institute entrance exams, psychological tests showed that he had a fiery temper. This was demonstrated by his draft into House Mars and constant reminders from Matteo.\n\nDarrow's sense of personal morality leaves him conflicted in many of his choices and decisions. While he demonstrates shrewdness and ruthless cunning in his decisions, he does deeply regret the harm wrought to those he cares for or respects. His devotion to The Rising remains rigid, despite moments of self-doubt, and eventually becomes willing to take great risks to achieve his goals. In an interview, Pierce Brown said that \"seeing Darrow from other people’s perspectives... he would seem like much more of a villain.\"",

    "text": "Even before he was carved into a Gold, Darrow was very athletic and shown to have highly impressive dexterity and strong grip, characteristics shared amongst most Helldivers. He also had a stronger heart than most other lowReds due to surviving the venomous bite of a Pitviper when he was a child. His dexterity impresses even other Golds, such as Mustang.\n\nAs a Gold, Darrow's powerful build and high bone density granted him superhuman speed and strength. The strength of his grip outclasses that of Titus, the largest member of House Mars. He was able to hold his breath underwater for over eight minutes and could withstand multiple Gs of force without passing out or vomiting. It is mentioned that Mickey's skills were so great that Darrow physically outmatches most Golds. During Darrow's recarving in Morning Star, Mickey made his ribs dense enough to withstand bullets.\n\nIn combat, Darrow is a formidable opponent. Initially, he could ably defeat other Golds during his time at the Institute despite lacking formal training. However, he was left for dead by Cassius after their duel. As time passed, his training under Lorn au Arcos fostered his growth, making him the last student of Arcos' fighting style known as the \"Willow Way\", a legendary form of Kravat created by Lorn known for its aggressive and precise strikes. This newfound skill allowed him to defeat Karnus au Bellona on his own and to avenge his loss to Cassius by cutting his arm off in a duel.\n\nAt 33 years old, Darrow is considered to be one of the best razor fighters, being the last master of the Willow Way. According to Pierce Brown, Darrow at 33 years old against Aja (who was in her 50's-60's in Morning Star) would end up with both of them dead. Against a weakened and older Lorn, Darrow might win, especially in zero gravity as he is better than Lorn in that gravity. Furthermore, Darrow's skill at this age allowed him to defeat a squad of Solar Republic Wardens with nothing but his razor and civilian clothing.",

    "text": "Even before becoming a Gold, Darrow had a natural talent in \"extrapolational thinking\", also called \"lateral thinking\", allowing him to think of indirect and creative approaches via reasoning would not be immediately obvious to others. The solutions he would come up with were often simplistic in hindsight, yet would allow him to completely change the paradigm in his favor. This unique trait is one that was found in successful military leaders and generals including Alexander, Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Caesar, and Napoleon.\n\nHaving rigorously studied military history during his infiltration of The Society, Darrow becomes a highly capable strategist and tactician. He leads House Mars to victory against considerable odds in the Institute and The Academy, defeating other competitors until only he and Karnus remain as commanders. Darrow's plans are relatively straightforward but extremely effective, being difficult to counteract due to their simplicity and aggression. This zeal allowed him to achieve victory against a previously undefeated military leader like Roque au Fabii, attacking and drilling into the enemy vessel alongside Helldivers to allow for boarding action. Also a ruthless pragmatist in battle, Darrow is willing to use tactics that would be considered underhanded or distasteful to achieve victory. This can be seen in his hiding of The Howlers in dead horses for an ambush on House Minerva to booby trapping Lorn's treasured garden with bombs to shred Aja's Obsidian and unbeknownst to her, lace her with trackable radioactive material as to track her back to Mars.",

As a lowRed of the Lambda clan, he was a member of the lowest caste of the Society, the rigid order controlling humanity. He lived under grueling conditions like the rest of his caste, exposed to radiation and starvation. When Darrow was young, his father, Dale, was hanged for rebelling against the Society.\n\nA few years after his father's death, Darrow's elder brother Kieran fell ill. Unable to pay the a Gamma or gray for medicine, Darrow traded a Gray a brass watch given to him by his father at the age of three or four for the medicine.\n\nBy the age of sixteen, Darrow had become a \"Helldiver\", the pilot of his clan's enormous ClawDrill mining vehicle. He made his living tunneling through Mars in search of helium-3, the precious resource that fuels the Society's terraforming projects. At the age of sixteen, Darrow married his childhood friend and sweetheart, Eo. She possessed a rebellious spirit that contrasted Darrow's resignation toward the cruelty of life as a miner. Despite (or perhaps because of) this glaring character difference, Darrow and Eo were very happy together.",

Following this disappointment, Eo illegally brought Darrow into a garden hidden within the mines. They were discovered and captured by Grays. When Eo and Darrow were to be punished for their crime by ArchGovernor of Mars Nero au Augustus himself, Eo sang The Forbidden Song, a traditional Red song banned by Gold, detailing a rebellion against the Society. For singing this song, Eo was sentenced to death and Darrow forced to watch as his wife was hanged. Following her execution, Darrow buried Eo (also a banned practice), for which he was sentenced to death as well.\n\nUnbeknownst to Darrow, his Uncle, Narol, had purposely poisoned him before he was to be hanged, and then did not pull his legs hard enough. Because of the poison slowing his heart enough to make a heartbeat undetectable, Narol was able to save Darrow from actual death.\n\nAfter awakening, Darrow was taken to the Sons of Ares, a terrorist group seeking to topple the Society. The rebels brought him to the planet's surface where Darrow discovered its vibrant cities, where people of all castes live in a highly-ordered society with Reds holding the lowest station of any color. Having been raised believing that Reds were pioneers aiding the terraforming of Mars, he was enraged when he discovered the truth. Inspired by Eo's dream of living for more than mere survival, Darrow took on a dangerous mission for the Sons of Ares. To help the rebels, he agreed to undergo massive biological augmentation to become a Gold and use the privilege of the ruling class to destroy the Society from within.\n\nRebirth",

He engaged in intense physical training and academic tutoring, preparing him to succeed in his masquerade as a Gold, and taking on the name of Andromedus.\n\nTo polish off Darrow's rough edges, his language and other social skills were cultivated by a Pink named Matteo, who also taught Darrow to manage his temper. Darrow was also cared for by Dancer and Harmony, Red members of the Sons of Ares.\n\nThe Institute\n\nAfter being educated, he took a test to enter the Institute of Mars, a training school for prospective military officers. Darrow was accepted, having missed only a single question out of hundreds to gain entrance. Here, he was drafted into House Mars by Fitchner, Mars' Proctor, who was impressed by Darrow's immense rage.\n\nUpon arriving, he was able to befriend other Golds, among them being the sons of the powerful Bellona family, Cassius au Bellona and Julian.

The alliance was able to bring down Titus, who Darrow later realized to be a fellow Red in disguise. Reluctantly, Darrow allowed Titus to be executed by an enraged Cassius who mistakenly believed Titus had killed Julian. He also captured House Minerva's standard, ending with the enslavement of House Minerva by House Mars. However, Darrow allowed Mustang to flee. Before retreating, Mustang informed Darrow about the Jackal, the unnamed Primus of House Pluto who had become a feared warlord. With this, Darrow earned his status as Primus.

During this time, he gained the nickname of the Reaper for carrying a scythe (known as a slingBlade by Reds) as his weapon and for conquering numerous Houses.\n\nDarrow then targeted House Mars, sneaking in one evening and carving a slingBlade into doors and tables to scare them. Sevro and his Howlers, under the belief that the Jackal had murdered Darrow, immeditaly abandoned House Mars to hunt down their friend's killer, later managing to find and join Darrow. In taking House Jupiter, they were able to capture a disguised Jackal after Darrow pinned his hand to a table with a knife. However, the Proctors interfered again and the Jackal escaped, having sawed off his own hand.

Darrow then reunited with Augustus and his allies, where they discussed their plans after plunging the Society into civil war. Here, Darrow met Daxo and Kavax, Pax's older brother and father, respectively. Speaking with Augustus, Darrow was able to predict his plan and agreed to it: an alliance with Lorn au Arcos.\n\nRecruiting the Rage Knight\n\nDarrow traveled to Europa, Lorn's domain, where he attempted to convince his teacher to side with him. Lorn refused, stating that he had chosen to live in neutrality and isolation with his remaining family. Lorn revealed that the Sovereign's forces were on Europa and attempted to help Darrow escape. Darrow refused, revealing that he knew about the presence of the Sovereign. He then ordered Roque to begin attacking the Sovereign's forces in orbit around Europa. Appearing as though Lorn betrayed Octavia, Darrow and Lorn were confronted by Tactus and Aja. Darrow used landmines to drive them off but Aja escaped, leaving Tactus behind.",

Lorn, however, decided to kill Tactus anyway in retaliation for the younger man threatening his family. Regardless, Lorn allied himself with Darrow.\n\nConsolidating Power\n\nUpon returning to the fleet, Darrow learned of a betrayal by Pliny, an adviser for Augustus. He had defected to the service of the Sovereign and had brought several Golds with him. Having kidnapped and killed key allies, Pliny was now a threat to their rebellion. In response, Darrow stormed Pliny's ship and confronted the traitor. Here, he was able to convince Pliny's followers to return to his side, resulting in Pliny's death at the hands of his former allies. During this time, Darrow also informed Ragnar of his Red heritage, seeking his assistance by appealing to Ragnar to live as a free man.\n\nHaving built enough military power, the next phase of the war against the Sovereign was enacted. The Jackal, controlling a large portion of all media outlets, broadcast a message across all available channels: the call for an Iron Rain on Mars, led by The Reaper.

Fortunately, Darrow was able to free himself and Ragnar. Together, they were able to save their remaining comrades and successfully mount a counter attack. Darrow then divided his forces into two groups: the Obsidians (led by Ragnar) who would open the gates of Agea and the Howlers who would help him find Octavia.\n\nThe Howlers were forced to travel on foot through the city, moving at full sprint for over fifteen miles. Sevro acted as a scout, having obtained a pair of functioning gravBoots. He informed them of Ragnar's success in opening the gates, killing the Wind Knight and defeating Cassius (who had become the Morning Knight) in the process.\n\nDarrow then rushed ahead, fearing the Sovereign's escape. Leaping onto her ship, he stood before her and her protectors alone. Despite killing Karnus, he was soon overwhelmed and too injured to keep fighting. Octavia then sent Fitchner to execute Darrow.

Unfortunately, Octavia was able to escape Mars, allowing her to gather her forces for retaliation against Darrow.\n\nReturn to Lykos\n\nAfter the battle, Darrow met with Fitchner and Dancer. Accompanied by Sevro, they discussed the future of the Sons of Ares. Fitchner then decided that the time for war was near, promising Darrow the full support of the Sons' spy network.

Repairing the Storm God with the help of Master Maker Glirastes and Harnassus (Orange commander of the Free Legions in Darrow's absence), the remaining Republic forces were able to manipulate the planet's weather to their advantage to cripple the Society's fleet as Orion synced with the terraformer. Darrow led the Howlers, sweeping away approaching Society forces approaching the city of Tyche under the cover of the storm. While they managed to turn the tide of the battle, Orion became unhinged and drowned the city of Tyche. This forced Darrow to kill Orion using a fail safe he had implanted in case she disobeyed his orders while using the Storm God. During this events, some explorers came with a captured member of the Legio XX Fulminata,  who actually was Screw Face, who was carved and put in the legion as an spy for the republic. Alexander tells Darrow that he and his knights will rescue the survivors of Tyche. Darrow believes Alexander will die on the mission, but commends his bravery by giving his own wolf cloak to Alex.",

Suspecting from Cato, who seem to be a Glirastes' old friend, Darrow lead the Cato's interrogation himself. Due to the lack of evidence indicating that Cato was anything more than a pixie, Darrow allowed him to live with Glirastes, but keeping an eye on him. However, it was something suspicious in the kid, and a phrase said by Cato made Darrow have an idea. He rushed at Sevro's cabin in the Morning Star, and took a blood-stained tunic that belonged to Octavia au Lune. After making a DNA test comparing Octavia's blood with Cato's, he discovered that Cato au Vitruvius was in fact Lysander au Lune, Octavia's grandchild, who he spared his life 10 years ago and put under the protection of Cassius au Belona. Knowing that, Darrow informed all the Howlers and lead an assault on Gliraste's house, only to find Alexandar's corpse and a wounded Rhonna.",
